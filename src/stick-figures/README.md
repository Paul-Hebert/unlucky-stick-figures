Each stick figure should have its own directory containing the following files:

1. A markdown file named `index.md`.
  - The contents of the file is a markdown description
  - YAML Front Matter includes:
    - title (string)
    - categories (array)
    - latitude/longitude
    - uploader-nickname (optional)
2. An image named `index.{png/jpg/jpeg}`
